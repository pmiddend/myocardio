* myocardio – automagically generate and display split plans

[[https://github.com/pmiddend/myocardio/actions/workflows/build-with-stack.yaml/badge.svg]]

** How does it work

myocardio is a small utility to generate exercise split plans for you. It recieves a list of exercises from you. For each exercise, you specify:

- exercise name
- which muscle groups are involved
- how many repetitions you make

The tool then generates and displays an exercise plan for you that /tries/ not to include exercises with big overlaps in muscle groups consecutively. It also prioritizes exercises that you haven’t done for some time.

The algorithm is described in [[./docs/ranking.pdf][this PDF file]].

The input is expected in JSON format at the location =$HOME/.config/myocardio/data.json= and looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "exercises": [
        {
            "muscles": [
                "pectoralis",
                "triceps",
                "deltoid",
                "core",
                "quadriceps",
                "hip flexor"
            ],
            "tagged": null,
            "reps": "3x10",
            "name": "Burpees",
            "last": null
        }
    ]
}
#+END_SRC

As you can see, the JSON is just a list of exercises. The format should be self-explanatory.

** Key bindings

| Key | Binding                                          |
|-----+--------------------------------------------------|
| t   | tag an exercise (meaning you did it today)       |
| j   | Go down a row (vim-style!)                       |
| k   | Go up a row                                      |
| c   | commit the plan (meaning you’re done exercising) |
| r   | Type in a new repetition count                   |

** Installation/Usage

Just clone the repository and type:

#+begin_example
stack run
#+end_example

This needs the [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/][stack]] build tool for Haskell.
