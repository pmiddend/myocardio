* myocardio – automagically generate and display split plans
** How does it work

myocardio is a small utility to generate exercise split plans for you. It recieves a list of exercises from you. For each exercise, you specify:

- exercise name
- which muscle groups are involved
- how many repetitions you make

The tool then generates and displays an exercise plan for you that /tries/ not to include exercises with big overlaps in muscle groups consecutively. It also prioritizes exercises that you haven’t done for some time.

The input is expected in JSON format at the location =$HOME/.config/myocardio/data.json= and looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "muscles": [
        "glute medius",
        "quadriceps",
        "core",
        "side core",
        "balance",
        "lower back",
        "calves",
        "gluteus maximus",
        "neck",
        "delta",
        "triceps",
        "hip flexor",
        "pectoralis",
        "rotators"
    ],
    "categories": [
        "normal"
    ],
    "exercises": [
        {
            "muscles": [
                "pectoralis",
                "triceps",
                "delta",
                "core",
                "quadriceps",
                "hip flexor"
            ],
            "category": "normal",
            "tagged": null,
            "reps": "3x10",
            "name": "Burpees",
            "last": null
        }
    ]
}
#+END_SRC

As you can see, you have a list of muscle groups and categories and then a list of exercises. The format should be self-explanatory.
